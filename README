# PRMSE paper

This is a repository for work on PRMSE paper. 

## Setting up

At this point, the changes in RSMTool necessary to compute prmse are in a separate branch `generalized-version-of-prmse`.

To create the environment:

1. follow steps 1-5 here. 

https://rsmtool.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html#setting-up

2. Run `git checkout `generalized-version-of-prmse`

3. Checkout paper directory from overleaf (see link below) in the directory of your choice.

4. Symlink the top paper directory to `prmse_paper/paper_overleaf`. This way the
 figures will be saved directly to the paper director. 

## Paper

The paper draft is on Overleaf:

## Analyses


### Simulations


Simulated data is stored under `data`. 
There are three files:

`data.csv` - main data file with human and system scores for each response

`raters.csv` - metadata file containing information about simulated raters

`systems.csv` - metadata file containing information about simulated systems


The code for simulations is divided into notebooks. 

`1_simulate_data`

The notebook used to simulate the data using the configuration settings stored in `notebooks/settings.json`.
The json file defines various parameters for the simulation.

Note that the data is simulated by sampling from normal distribution using fixed seed. 
Changes to the code in this notebook are likely to change the simulated data. 
The data is stored on Bitbucket to track any changes.

The rest of the notebook are organized by how many human raters and systems are used in each analyses. 

Note that the structure of the notebooks does not follow the order of analyses in the paper:
in the paper we first show the gaps in traditional metrics and then demonstrate that PRMSE can help address those.
In the notebooks, it is more efficient to keep the analyses with and without PRMSE in the same notebook as long as they use the same data. 

`exp_1A2H` - evaluations of the same system against multiple pairs of raters

`exp_NA2H` - evaluations of multiple systems against different pairs of raters

`exp_1ANH` - evaluations of the same system against an increasing number of raters
